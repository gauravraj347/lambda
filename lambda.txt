
1. A lambda expression is a short and concise way to represent a single method interface (also known as a functional interface) using an expression. It can be used to create anonymous 
functions that can be passed as arguments or returned as values. For example, `(x, y) -> x + y` is a lambda expression that represents a function that takes two parameters and returns 
their sum.
2. Yes, you can pass lambda expressions to a method as a parameter, as long as the type of the parameter is a functional interface that matches the signature and return type of the 
lambda expression. This is useful when you want to pass a custom behavior or logic to a method without creating a separate class or interface. For example, you can pass a lambda
expression to the `forEach()` method of a collection, which takes a `Consumer` functional interface as a parameter. For example, `list.forEach(x -> System.out.println(x));` will print each element of the list using a lambda expression.

3. A functional interface in Java 8 is an interface that has only one abstract method. It can also have default and static methods, but they do not count as abstract methods. A functional
interface can be annotated with `@FunctionalInterface`, which is optional but helps the compiler to check if the interface is valid. A functional interface can be implemented by a lambda
expression, a method reference, or an anonymous class. Some examples of functional interfaces are `Predicate`, `Function`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`, etc.

4. We use lambda expressions in Java to achieve functional programming, which is a style of programming that focuses on functions and expressions rather than objects and statements. 
Lambda expressions make the code more concise, readable, and expressive. They also enable us to use higher-order functions, which are functions that can take other functions as 
parameters or return them as values. Lambda expressions also support parallel and concurrent programming, as they are stateless and can be easily distributed across multiple threads 
or processors.

5. No, it is not mandatory for a lambda expression to have parameters. A lambda expression can have zero, one, or more parameters. The parameters are enclosed in parentheses and 
separated by commas. If there is only one parameter and its type can be inferred from the context, the parentheses can be omitted. For example, `() -> System.out.println("Hello");` 
is a lambda expression with no parameters, `(x) -> x * x` and `x -> x * x` are equivalent lambda expressions with one parameter, and `(x, y) -> x + y` is a lambda expression with two 
parameters.
